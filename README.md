# Snake Game

This is my solution to the classic arcade game Snake

## My MVP for Snake

My main focus was on implementing the game logic. I may go back and add a score
and game over screen.

## Why I chose this project

I have been wanting to improve my problem solving skills and what better way to
do that then by making a game. My main goal with this project was to break the game
logic up into small problems and solve them one at a time without looking at a
solution.

## What I learned

I realized that I need to learn about design patterns. Also, I got hard stuck on how
to move the snake body. I did have to research that which lead me down
a rabbit hole about object mutability and how objects are designed in python.
